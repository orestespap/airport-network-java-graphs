# airport-network-java-graphs
Object-oriented project written in Java, that includes basic airport functionalities, including information, destination and duration between flights.  I have also equipped the JFreeChart library in order to include a graph which displays all the air flight connections.  The project also features graphics for basic user interaction, using the JFrame library.
